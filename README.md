# Capstone-end-project---marketing-data-analysis

**Summary**

This project analyzes restaurant data using Python, beginning with cleaning steps such as handling missing values, removing duplicates, and standardizing column names to make the dataset ready for analysis.

Exploratory analysis looks at the geographical distribution of restaurants, identifies leading franchises with national presence, and examines the availability of table booking and online delivery. It also compares customer votes between restaurants that deliver and those that do not.

The study of cuisines explores the top 10 cuisines across cities, the number of cuisines served per restaurant, and the most popular cuisine in each city. Cost distribution and rating patterns are also analyzed to understand customer preferences.

Key insights reveal that online delivery and table booking increase customer engagement, certain franchises dominate nationally, and cuisine preferences differ by city. These results provide valuable guidance for improving restaurant services and targeting customer needs.
